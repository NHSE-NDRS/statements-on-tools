In this book we've compiled a set of technical resources, links and write down our experiences of using open data science programs like R and Python within the NHS and beyond.

It is highly opinionated and is not representative or endorsed by the NHS or any organisations within the NHS, public sector or civil service. 
Whilst the views are written by members of the NHS-R Community, these too may not necessarily be shared with everyone equally and even may change over time.
