# Contributing to GitHub repositories

The NHS-R Community welcomes contributions in the form of bug fixes and improvements.

## Contributing workflow

If you're new to Github and/or Markdown, [Github's own contributor's guide](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) provides a good overview of these topics.

To contribute:

- Review the [issue](#using-issues) list, raise an issue if required
- Fork this repository
- Make changes or add new scripts
- Commit and push to your own repository
- Create a new [pull request](#pull-requests-and-merging) detailing your additions
- Wait for pull request to be reviewed, and merged (not everyone will have permission to merge pull requests)
- Celebrate your first step into the open source world and contribute more!

## Using issues

If you spot something that needs to be changed, or would like to suggest some new content, please raise an issue.

Before raising a new issue, have a look through the existing ones in case it's already been raised.

## Pull requests and merging

- If you have a change (or a new page) to raise, please create an issue first as there may be someone thinking of contributing something similar.

- The main branch will be restricted to just those with access to the repository and they are asked to not commit directly as good practice.

- For all changes you will need to create a fork, and then a pull request (click compare across forks and select your version).

Please [reference the issue the pull request resolves](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue), so it will be closed automatically.

## Contributing any datasets

Particularly for packages like [{NHSRdatasets}](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRdatasets):

- Add your dataset in the `data` folder, in `.rda` format.  
The best way to do this is with the {usethis} package with "gzip" compression:  `usethis::use_data(data, compress="gzip")`  

## Contributing guidelines and etiquette

- Preview your Markdown code to make sure the format is not broken.
- Material, including commit messages, should be written in clear and simple English.
- Nothing included should be confidential, private or disclose any personal or sensitive data (and that is also necessary for commits as well as code).
- Follow the code of conduct in the repository at all times.
- For further guidance refer to the NHS-R Way [Style Guides](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/style-guides.html).

When contributing any additions, the contributor certifies that they are the author, or has cited the author and is authorised to reuse/reference the material

## Code of Conduct

When contributing to the NHS-R Community GitHub's the Code of Conduct should be followed and can be found in the repository as `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
This document can be generated, if missing or it is a new repository by using the {usethis} package and the following code:

```
usethis::use_code_of_conduct(contact = "nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net")
```
