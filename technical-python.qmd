## What programs are required for a computer

To write Python code you will need the [Python program](https://www.python.org/downloads/), an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and Python is supported within [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (including in Quarto scripts).

Installing Python will require admin rights for the person installing it.

To check that Python has been installed (on Windows) open the Command Prompt (accessed via the Windows button on the keyboard on a Windows computer) and type `py --version`.
