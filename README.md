This is an evolving document which describes how and why to use R and other data science tools and to share and reuse code safely in health and social care settings.

The scope and content are expanding all the time as the community collaboratively produces a definitive statement of the [NHS-R way](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/).

Please file issues, make pull requests, and get involved, we're very happy from hear from friends from inside and outside of NHS-R.
