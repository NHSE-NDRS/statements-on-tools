# Open code in the NHS

## Introduction

There are number of organisations and publications advocating open coding in its various guises within the NHS and more
generally across the public sector and academia.
This page is intended as a place to collate relevant literature and proposed/tried approaches to implement open code policies in the NHS, from individual teams up to entire organisations.

There is also a significant crossover between open code and software engineering best practice, which means that they are often promoted together as an effective means to improve reproducibility.

We will publish a digital playbook on how to open source your code for health and care organisations. Guidance on where to put the code, how to license and maintain it, and best practice for working with suppliers will be published in addition to case studies of teams who have done this – completed May 2022.

## Specific challenges

### Opening code without exposing data/'secrets'

In coding terms exposing [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#about-encrypted-secrets) often mean sharing passwords or keys but for the data analysis that occurs in the NHS and other public sector organisations, this will also mean the sharing of personal, clinical or other sensitive data.
In practice there are a number of approaches to avoiding this happening, see the specific NHS approaches: 

- NHSx Open Source Policy[-@nhsx_osp] (note NHSx is now NHS England but this hasn't been adopted as an NHS England Policy), 
- NHS England's R Reporting[-@nhse_report] and 
- CDU Data Science Team [blogs about GitHub](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/index.html#category:GitHub)[-@cdu] 
- Making source code open and reusable[-@gds-open] (provides broad requirements like storing secret keys and credentials separately)

and these include setting up repositories so there are automated restrictions to prevent and reduce the risk of unintentional disclosure of any sensitive data.

Nevertheless, we do have to rely upon people using these recommendations and setting up their systems which is very similar to our use of email or social media accounts. 
As an example, with email we need to rely upon senders using the blind copy in email if the recipients include patients or the public as there is no automated way to prevent a breach of emails otherwise.
Consequently, mistakes have and do happen and there are mechanisms which are in place to [report these breaches](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/information-governance/guidance/personal-data-breaches/) and does not mean that we prevent people from using email or social media. 
Systems like GitHub do offer the possibility to set up processes to prevent, reverse and delete accidental sharing (breaches) but are still subject to reporting for near misses and incidents when these occur.
However, it may be that these are only reported locally and do not, currently, get shared more widely.

### Opening code without giving away commercial/business/clinical proprietary information (and Intellectual Property)

The issue of intellectual property is a very difficult one to argue against, particularly when analysts and data scientists are not necessarily trained or familiar in this area of law.
However, it is often used as a reason why not to share specific code, like SQL, but without any formal detail as to how this will be breaking any laws. 
By publishing SQL code it is often assumed that the structure of the databases, which is owned by a company, could be inadvertently revealed.
However, there are examples of clinical database schemas like that of [TPP](https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/opensafely-tpp-database-schema/) who own SystmOne and which has been shared as part of the [OpenSafely](https://www.opensafely.org/) secure analytics platform for NHS electronic health records and it could be said that discussions related to sharing code should be considered as part of the procurement process.
And also Government guidance, [When code should be open or closed](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed), from the Central Digital & Data Office states:

> Unless your database schema contains credentials it is not sensitive and can be open. You should store any credentials separately and keep them closed.

### Coding in the open

There is, currently, no one policy or procedure that can be referred to in terms of coding in the open. 
Whilst it has been recommended strongly in many of the important reviews available to the NHS like Data Saves Lives -@data-saves-lives] and Goldacre Review[-@goldacre_2022] there continues to be little guidance on what this looks like in day to day work.
Some teams have published in the open, like the CDU Data Science Team [-@cdu] and features as a case study example, however, the team has changed in approach and name as of 2023 and the blog site is no longer being updated.
The NHSx Open Source policy[-@nhsx_osp] recommended that all development/analytics work done in the NHS be coded in the open unless there is good reason not to.
However, NHSx moved into NHS England in 2022 and the GitHub repository (where this is published) and continues to state:

> Current status: Version 1.0 - This policy is currently going through internal review as part of the adoption process.

It is worth noting, in terms of open coding, this document also says:

> An internal code review should be conducted for all open source projects and specific responsibilities must be met within or close to the development team. 

Reviews could be deemed to slow the process of sharing code openly and so needs to be considered within the context of software code maintenance which is a subject in itself.
Books on [code review principles](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/reviewer/purpose.html) from the Tidyteam at Posit can be a really good place to start.

The Making source code open and reusable[-@gds-open] suggests making your code open from the start and gives a short check list on what to consider when making existing code open.

## Licences/Licenses

To clarify on spelling: [license](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/licence-license/) is both a noun and a verb in US English, but in UK English licence may be used for a noun and license as a verb.
As the programs and tools, like GitHub, are often US based the word license is the usual expected spelling.
This becomes important for searches, which is why the header title here has both spelling - just in case.

Although documents like Data saves lives[-@data-saves-lives] states there was an intention to:

>publish a digital playbook on how to open source your code for health and care organisations. Guidance on where to put the code, how to license and maintain it, and best practice for working with suppliers will be published in addition to case studies of teams who have done this – completed May 2022.

this hasn't led to any particular document to explain when or how to use licenses.
The reference to a digital playbook where the requirement is to:

> create a project that can be used by other healthcare organisations

links to case study [scenarios](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-playbooks/open-source-digital-playbook/i-want-to-create-a-project-that-can-be-used-by-other-healthcare-organisations/) which may have information, but which will require reading through to check and reference.
One site that is listed is the CDU Data Science Team[-@cdu] and whilst this team used licenses there was never any explicit mention on how or when to use them.

Government documents like the Duck book[-@duck] do have sections on [copyright and licenses](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/project_documentation.html?highlight=licen#copyright-and-licenses) and their recommendations, along with the [Analysis Function](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/open-sourcing-analytical-code/), are to use [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) and [OGL](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

The Making source code open and reusable[-@gds-open] [states](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable#licensing-your-code):

>You should publish your code under an [Open Source Initiative compatible licence](https://opensource.org/licenses). For example, GDS uses the [MIT licence](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/manuals/licensing.html).

>All code produced by civil servants is automatically covered by [Crown Copyright](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/crown-copyright/).

However, many people who are part of the NHS-R Community are not considered [civil servants](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/civil-service-staff-numbers#:~:text=In%20this%20way%2C%20civil%20servants,not%20counted%20as%20civil%20servants.):

>... civil servants are defined much more narrowly than public sector workers: police, teachers, NHS staff, members of the armed forces and local government officers are not counted as civil servants.

Even where a person's work is covered by being a Civil Servant, it is still really good practice to include the corresponding license to any published work as it cannot be assumed that people know the work is covered by the license or that the person was a Civil Servant.

### NHS-R Community use of licenses

NHS-R Community repositories are licensed under [MIT](https://pitt.libguides.com/openlicensing/MIT#:~:text=Like%20the%20Apache%202.0%2C%20and,sell%20copies%20of%20the%20software.) for code based projects like Shiny apps and packages:

>the MIT License is a permissive software license that places few restrictions of reuse. Users of software using an MIT License are permitted to use, copy, modify, merge publish, distribute, sublicense and sell copies of the software. 

and [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) for text based projects like training and books (like this):

> allows the creator to retain copyright whilst allowing others to copy and distribute and make use of their work non-commercially. The Creative Commons license also ensures creators get the recognition and credit for the work they produce and share.

Whilst there is a cross over between text and code, these two licenses offer the freedom for resuse.

### Setting up licenses

There are two ways to starting a repository for sharing on GitHub.
Firstly, there is creating a repository directly on the [GitHub website](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) and you can select the appropriate license as you do that. 

If, however, you create the project locally, using R for example, you can add a license to it using a package called {usethis} and typing in the R console:

```
usethis::use_cc0_license()
usethis::use_mit_license()
```
OGL though does not appear in the selections for {usethis} or GitHub.
